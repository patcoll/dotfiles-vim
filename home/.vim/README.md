# vimrc

this setup uses vundle to manage vim plugins. with a posix environment, you
should be able to do:

    ./install

which will install Vundle, then install all plugins configured in `vimrc`.

thats it.

## caveats

i believe the vim cmd-line options this uses requires vim 7.4+, though i'm not
positive.
